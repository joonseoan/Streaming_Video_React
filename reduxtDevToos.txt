1. visit redux-devtools-extension.
2. add extension to chrom browser.
3. In index.js (main root ) of the codes, add the followings.

import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';

// redux devtools extension
const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

// we do not need thunk because we do not need to us async functions.
const store = createStore(
    reducers,
    composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware())
);

4. If the redux icon is activated with green light,
    click the icon in the browser.

5. click left-side and middle icon at the buttom.
    => the another window will be populated.

6. click state button.
    => We can find auth state with isSignedIn and id information.

7. debug
localhost:3000?debug_session=afadfadf(any string);
=> then change redux state. => it won't change the dispatches inside of redux tools
==> for instance, let's assume that the last dispatch is "Sign in"
==>  refresh the brwoser. We can still find "Sign-in"
